# Revise_javascript
### A Synchronous, Single-Threaded, Dynamically Typed Language
Synchronous means code executes line by line, in order, from top to bottom
JavaScript runs in a single thread, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time
Variables in JavaScript don't need explicit type declarations
A variable's type can change during runtime
